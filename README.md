# 2048
Implementation of the popular 2016 videogame 2048 in Java (both GUI and Text Versions)


To run the .java files submitted with this readme file, open them with eclipse and click the green play button on the top bar to execute the program. 

There are two classes included in the source file: Board and GUIFrame. The first the the text-based UI version of the game, and the latter is the GUI based version of the game. 

NOTE: in the GUI version w,a,s,d are replaced with arrow keys but the idea is the same, the game only responds to the arrow keys, q and r and y, n (for confirming quit and restart)

The score is calculated as the sum of all the tiles in play
